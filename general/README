General scripts that do not belong to Caffe or Theano in particular.

-> biasVariance.py - This is a script that demonstrates the bias-variance tradeoff using probability 
distributions and histograms. We are need to estimate a probability distribution, a Gaussian in our
case. The model we use to estimate it is a histogram. The model complexity is given by the number of 
bins. Samples drawn from the Gaussian will function as training examples. We will vary the bin size to 
get an understanding of bias and variance.

To run this code : python biasVariance.py

Dependencies : you will need numpy and matplotlib
